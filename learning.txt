1) create basic web based calculator application 
2) use git to store source code and all the files .
3) use jenkins to build and test the application .
4) use docker for deployment.


learning points:
1) flask render_template directly looks into templates directory in ur application directory so dont forget to 
   add this directory at start of project and put all html and related files into it.

very basic app created .Now listing dependecies to create image.
1) port : 5000
2) install python and update 
	done that 
3) Flask
	
4) run app on start. 
	

expose port but dont forget to add ip address of host in python code. 
	host means container ip address.
